⚡ Reflected XSS – High Security Level

### 🛠️ Objective:
Bypass stronger filtering and encoding mechanisms to execute JavaScript.

---

### 🔍 What’s New?

- Input is now sanitized or encoded more strictly:
  - `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `/` often encoded to `&lt;`, `&gt;`, etc.
  - The application may block common payload structures.

---

### 🧪 Advanced Payloads

Try variations that break the filter logic:
```html
<svg/onload=confirm(1)>
````

Or encoded tricks (if the system allows decoding):

```html
<iframe src="javascript:alert(1)">
```

Another bypass using event handlers:

```html
<details open ontoggle=alert(1)>
```

### ⚠️ Might Require Manual Testing

Use **Burp Suite** to observe:

* How the application reflects or encodes your input
* Whether characters are escaped or neutralized
* If any injection points remain open

### 🧩 Summary

* ✅ Advanced filtering and encoding
* ⚠️ Bypasses possible with novel payloads
* 🔴 May vary based on DVWA encoding behavior

## ✅ Status

* ⚠️ Potentially exploitable with advanced payloads
* 🔴 Advanced level
