🧨 Blind SQL Injection – High Security Level

### 🛠️ Objective:
Bypass more advanced controls and confirm whether blind SQL injection is still possible.

---

### 🔍 What’s Different?

- Form structure is separated behind a prompt or modal.
- Parameters are the same but may be encoded or slightly renamed.
- Still vulnerable to Boolean-based SQL injection.

### 🧭 Exploitation Steps

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept the request after clicking **“Click here to change ID”** and submitting a value.
2. Find the vulnerable `id` parameter.

3. Inject a payload:
   ```sql
   1' AND SUBSTRING(user,1,1)='a'#
````

4. Observe the difference in response:

   * ✅ If true: You’ll see confirmation that user ID exists.
   * ❌ If false: You’ll get the “missing” message.

Continue character-by-character to extract user info.

### 🧩 Summary

* ❌ No output from the query
* ✅ Logical behavior still leaks info
* ✅ Works identically with correct payload

## ✅ Status

* ✅ Fully exploitable
* 🔴 Requires close observation and logic-based guessing
