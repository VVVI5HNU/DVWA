# 🔐 DVWA Vulnerability Levels Explained

DVWA provides four different **security levels** to simulate how web vulnerabilities behave under various real-world protections. Each level introduces increasing difficulty and improved security mechanisms.

---

## 🟢 Low

- **Description:** Minimal or no security controls.
- **Goal:** Demonstrate how easily a vulnerability can be exploited when basic protections are missing.
- **Common traits:**
  - No input validation
  - No rate limiting
  - Clear and verbose error messages
  - No CSRF protection or session validation

✅ Great for beginners to learn exploitation techniques.

---

## 🟡 Medium

- **Description:** Introduces basic defensive measures.
- **Goal:** Show how small changes (e.g., delays, basic sanitization) can affect exploitability.
- **Common traits:**
  - Basic input filtering
  - Static delays (e.g., `sleep()` to slow brute force)
  - More generic error responses

⚠️ Exploitable with more effort, often requires automation or timing analysis.

---

## 🔴 High

- **Description:** Simulates a semi-secure environment.
- **Goal:** Teach attackers how to bypass intermediate security like CSRF tokens and smarter input validation.
- **Common traits:**
  - Dynamic anti-CSRF tokens
  - Stronger input filtering
  - Session-bound protections
  - Manual or macro-based token handling required

🧠 Requires advanced tools like Burp Suite macros or scripting.

---

## ⚫ Impossible

- **Description:** Designed to be secure.
- **Goal:** Demonstrate how proper development practices can completely mitigate the vulnerability.
- **Common traits:**
  - Secure coding practices
  - Validated CSRF tokens
  - Secure session management
  - Sanitized and parameterized input

✅ Not exploitable under normal conditions. Serves as a reference for developers on **how to do it right**.

## 📌 Summary Table

| Level      | Description               | Exploitable? | Skill Required |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Low        | No protection              | ✅ Yes       | 🟢 Easy        |
| Medium     | Basic protection           | ✅ Yes       | 🟡 Moderate    |
| High       | Realistic protection       | ✅ Yes       | 🔴 Advanced    |
| Impossible | Fully secure (by design)   | ❌ No        | ⚫ Not exploitable |

## 🧠 Tip for Learners

By testing the same vulnerability at different security levels, you learn:
- How each protection affects the attack surface
- Why secure development practices matter
- How real-world applications are (or should be) hardened
