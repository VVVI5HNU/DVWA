# üîê DVWA Vulnerability Levels Explained

DVWA provides four different **security levels** to simulate how web vulnerabilities behave under various real-world protections. Each level introduces increasing difficulty and improved security mechanisms.

---

## üü¢ Low

- **Description:** Minimal or no security controls.
- **Goal:** Demonstrate how easily a vulnerability can be exploited when basic protections are missing.
- **Common traits:**
  - No input validation
  - No rate limiting
  - Clear and verbose error messages
  - No CSRF protection or session validation

‚úÖ Great for beginners to learn exploitation techniques.

---

## üü° Medium

- **Description:** Introduces basic defensive measures.
- **Goal:** Show how small changes (e.g., delays, basic sanitization) can affect exploitability.
- **Common traits:**
  - Basic input filtering
  - Static delays (e.g., `sleep()` to slow brute force)
  - More generic error responses

‚ö†Ô∏è Exploitable with more effort, often requires automation or timing analysis.

---

## üî¥ High

- **Description:** Simulates a semi-secure environment.
- **Goal:** Teach attackers how to bypass intermediate security like CSRF tokens and smarter input validation.
- **Common traits:**
  - Dynamic anti-CSRF tokens
  - Stronger input filtering
  - Session-bound protections
  - Manual or macro-based token handling required

üß† Requires advanced tools like Burp Suite macros or scripting.

---

## ‚ö´ Impossible

- **Description:** Designed to be secure.
- **Goal:** Demonstrate how proper development practices can completely mitigate the vulnerability.
- **Common traits:**
  - Secure coding practices
  - Validated CSRF tokens
  - Secure session management
  - Sanitized and parameterized input

‚úÖ Not exploitable under normal conditions. Serves as a reference for developers on **how to do it right**.

## üìå Summary Table

| Level      | Description               | Exploitable? | Skill Required |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Low        | No protection              | ‚úÖ Yes       | üü¢ Easy        |
| Medium     | Basic protection           | ‚úÖ Yes       | üü° Moderate    |
| High       | Realistic protection       | ‚úÖ Yes       | üî¥ Advanced    |
| Impossible | Fully secure (by design)   | ‚ùå No        | ‚ö´ Not exploitable |

## üß† Tip for Learners

By testing the same vulnerability at different security levels, you learn:
- How each protection affects the attack surface
- Why secure development practices matter
- How real-world applications are (or should be) hardened
